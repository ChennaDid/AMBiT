Version information. The versions are tagged in CVS using the naming convention
  Atomic1_1_1
Changes sorted as follows
Bug: Bug fixes.
Opt: Optimisations.
Alt: Alterations for cosmetic/usage reasons or improved accuracy (not bugs).
Add: Added functionality.
Del: Removed functionality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug: DiscreteState::CheckSize() remove numerical wobbles at tail;
     Core::UpdateExcitedState() checks if state is in open shells first;
     removed lucky zero in HamiltonianMatrix::GetSz(); removed lucky zero
     from Core::IterateDiscreteStateGreens():exchange potential.
     ExcitedStates::Orthogonalise() orthogonalise to states with smaller
     pqn only (this is needed when all states are updated).
Opt: MBPTCalculator::CalculateCorrelation* uses Constant::Electron3j();
     RStates and CustomBasis update using previous HF states instead of
     just rebuilding from scratch.
Alt: Maximum iterations of Davidson method changed from 2000 -> 20000;
     added size in atomic units to Debug::LogHFIterations output.

1.1.4 - 08/03/05
Alt: New method of converging Hartree-Fock by damping changes in electron
     states at each iteration. Big changes to Core::Update() and
     Core::CalculateExcitedState().
Bug: HamiltonianMatrix::~HamiltonianMatrix(): check to see if M is NULL
     before deletion; State::NumZeroes now removes start and tail to exclude
     small oscillations about zero.
Add: Support for jcb2pc in make.machine.
Del: Convergence method based on tail matching, except for local exchange
     approximation. Thus CalculateDiscreteState->ConvergeStateApproximation.
Del: UpdateHFPotentialNoSelfInteraction() and
     CalculateExchangeNoSelfInteraction() are no longer required.

1.1.3 - 22/02/05
Bug: FeII configuration; sign in GetSMSIntegral().
Alt: Atom.h and Atom/OpenShellEnergy(); call to DSPEVX in Davidson changed
     to improve accuracy.
Opt: MPIMatrix modified for better load distribution and moved to 
     Configuration; SMS in HamiltonianMatrix (which introduced the bug that
     needed fixing).
Add: CorePolarisability and Core::GetRadius(); Matrix::GetDiagonal();
     versions.txt (this file).

1.1.2
Opt: GenerateProjections for MPI.
Bug: GetEigenvalue wasn't providing space for MPI::Reduce().

1.1.1
Del: HFExcitedStates.
Bug: BSplineGrid::CreateSplineKnots().

1.1
Opt: Many.
Add: Compilations options for linux cluster; parallel support using MPI;
     link to f77 directly (no more f2c).
Alt: I/O; interface functions in Atom; DebugOptions altered, made global;
     Merged RelativisticInfo, SingleParticleInfo with StateInfo.
Bug: Memory leak in Core::CalculateDiscreteState().

1.1.1.1
non-parallel, Win32 + Unix, HF + CI + MBPT (single particle only)
